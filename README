NAME
    RPC::Any - A simple, unified interface to XML-RPC and JSON-RPC.

DESCRIPTION
    RPC::Any is a simple, unified interface to multiple RPC protocols. Right
    now it supports <XML-RPC> and all three versions of <JSON-RPC> (1.0,
    1.1, and 2.0).

    The goal of RPC::Any is to be simple to use, and to be highly
    extendable. RPC::Any is designed to work properly in taint mode, and
    fully supports Unicode. It was written for real-world use in a major
    production application.

    If you're planning to use RPC::Any, you probably want to see
    RPC::Any::Server. In the future, there will also be an
    "RPC::Any::Client".

BUGS
    RPC::Any is relatively new, but it has very extensive tests and is being
    heavily used in a <major production application>. However, there could
    still be bugs lurking in its code.
